## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
1. Twitter (2 of my favorite features are (1)direct messages to other app users and (2)a bookmarks bar with saved posts)
2. YouTube (2 of my favorite features are (1)a youtube shorts page where you can scroll through quick video snippets and (2) a notifications feature where you get notified when channels you subscribe to post)
3. TikTok (2 of my favorite features are (1) adding comments to videos and (2))being able to switch between a for you page and a page that only has videos from people you follow)

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
    Figuring out how github worked was a struggle initially but after I looked at the video walkthrough I was able to figure it out.
